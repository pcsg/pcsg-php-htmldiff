# php-htmldiff
> A library for comparing two HTML files/snippets and highlighting the differences using simple HTML.

This is a fork of the abandoned and removed library `nexxome/php-htmldiff`.  
The fork provides compatibility with PHP 8.0 and proper PSR namespace support

This HTML Diff implementation is a PHP port of the ruby implementation found at https://github.com/myobie/htmldiff.  
This is also available in C# at https://github.com/Rohland/htmldiff.net.
